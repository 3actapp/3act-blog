## Our Mission

At **3act**, we believe that the secret to lasting change isn't willpower — it's **accountability**. We're building the tools and resources to help people show up every day, build unbreakable habits, and achieve their most ambitious goals through the power of community.

## What Is 3act?

3act is a **free social habit tracker** available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6756503513). It's designed around one powerful idea: you're far more likely to stick with your habits when someone else is watching.

With 3act, you can:

- **Track your daily habits** with a beautiful, simple interface
- **Build streaks** and earn XP for consistency
- **Connect with friends** and form accountability crews
- **See each other's progress** in real-time
- **Stay motivated** through social accountability

The app is completely free — no hidden fees, no premium tiers, no ads. Just a tool built to help you become the person you want to be.

## About This Blog

The 3act Blog is our knowledge hub for everything related to **accountability, habit formation, productivity, and personal growth**. Every article is researched, science-backed, and written to give you practical strategies you can implement today.

We cover topics like:

- **The science of accountability** — why being watched changes everything
- **Habit formation** — how to build habits that actually stick
- **Productivity** — strategies to stop procrastinating and get more done
- **App reviews** — honest comparisons of the best tools available

## Our Values

**Science-backed.** We don't share opinions — we share research. Every claim in our articles is grounded in peer-reviewed studies and established psychological principles.

**Practical.** Theory is great, but action is better. Every article includes actionable steps you can take immediately.

**Honest.** We're transparent about what works, what doesn't, and where 3act fits into the picture. We'll never mislead you.

**Community-first.** We believe in the power of people helping people. That's why 3act is free, and that's why we share our knowledge openly on this blog.
